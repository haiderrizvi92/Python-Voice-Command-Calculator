## Python-Voice-Command-Calculator
# Here is the logic:

1. At first, we will set our microphone device.
2. Accept voice from the user with the mic.
3. Remove noise and distortion from the speech.
4. Convert the speech or voice to text.
5. Now store the text as a string in a variable.
6. Print the string if you wish. ( Not necessary but it will help you determine if the text is all right or not )
7. split the string into three parts:
8. first operand, operator and the second operand
9. Now convert the operands to integers.
10. Finally, do the calculation in your program as you got all the things you need.
